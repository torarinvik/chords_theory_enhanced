// Cross-thread contract: setNotes/setLoopBounds/setBpm/play/stop/seek/isPlaying/getPlayheadBeat/
// getBpm are message-thread only; renderNextBlock is audio-thread only, called from
// ChordSynthEngine::renderNextBlock. The note list is a fixed-capacity, wait-free double-buffer
// (message thread writes the *inactive* buffer, then flips an atomic index with release ordering;
// the audio thread acquire-loads that index once per block and reads whichever buffer it currently
// names) - no heap allocation, no locking, on either side. Loop bounds/play-state/playhead/bpm/
// pending-seek are plain atomics; play()/seek() publish the playhead before the isPlaying flag
// (release ordering) so the audio thread's acquire-load of isPlaying is guaranteed to see the
// seeked playhead too.
